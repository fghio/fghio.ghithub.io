        Sometimes, I feel like I create problems just to solve them. 
        Other times, I feel like I take small, insignificant issues and blow them 
        out of proportion just so I can devise an absolutely overpowered 
        solution to tackle them.
        <br><br>
        This is one of those times.

        What is Collectify?
      </h2>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Recently, a sticker collection was released based on a popular Italian 
        comic that had a big impact on me during my (pre)teen years. It ran 
        through to about the time I finished my university studies. It's a comic 
        that's probably not very well-known outside of Italy, but one I hold 
        very dear. It's a humorous comic with a surprisingly deep overarching 
        plot, quirky characters, and jokes that have become a part of my daily 
        life. On top of that, the artwork and covers have become iconic and 
        beautiful in my eyes. Here’s a glimpse of what I mean:
      </p>
        
      <div class="comics-container">
        <div class="comicbook"><img src="https://www.comicsbox.it/cover/RATMANCL_001.jpg" alt="RatMan Collection 1"></div>
        <div class="comicbook"><img src="https://www.comicsbox.it/cover/RATMANCL_002.jpg" alt="RatMan Collection 2"></div>
        <div class="comicbook"><img src="https://www.comicsbox.it/cover/RATMANCL_003.jpg" alt="RatMan Collection 3"></div>
        <div class="comicbook"><img src="https://www.comicsbox.it/cover/RATMANCL_019.jpg" alt="RatMan Collection 19"></div>
        <div class="comicbook"><img src="https://www.comicsbox.it/cover/RATMANCL_038.jpg" alt="RatMan Collection 38"></div>
        <div class="comicbook"><img src="https://www.comicsbox.it/cover/RATMANCL_057.jpg" alt="RatMan Collection 57"></div>
      </div>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        It's easy to see why I decided to start (and hopefully complete, fingers 
        crossed!) the sticker collection tied to this comic.
        <br><br>
        Of course, this isn't the only collection I’ve started or am trying to 
        complete. Keeping track of what I’m missing across different collections, 
        however, can be a bit of a challenge. I imagine other collectors face the 
        same problem, so I thought, "Why not create a tool to help keep track of 
        my collection progress?"
        <br><br>
        I looked around on app stores and found some solutions, but they were always 
        tailored to specific themes, often Pokémon-related, and not very 
        customizable. So, to familiarize myself a bit more with 
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html">Tkinter</a>, 
        I decided to create my own personal "application": 
        <a href="https://github.com/fghio/collectify">Collectify</a>.
      </p>

      <a style="display: flex; justify-content: center; padding-bottom: 10pt;" 
        target="_blank"
        href="https://github.com/fghio/collectify"><img src="https://gh-card.dev/repos/fghio/collectify.svg?fullname=">
      </a>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The name might not be the most creative (I know a TM also exists with 
        this name, shhh!), but in cases like this, it's the function that 
        matters most.
      </p>

      <h2 id="HowDoesItWork" style="scroll-margin: 1em;">
        <a href="#HowDoesItWork" class="headerlink" title="HowDoesItWork"></a>
        How does it work?
      </h2>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Probably easier done than said! Let's start with the practical steps. 
        First, make sure you have a working version of Python 3. Then, clone the
        <a href="https://github.com/fghio/collectify">repository</a>, 
        or create a copy of it. Once that's done, open a terminal and type the 
        following:
      </p>
      
      <div class="code-container">
        python3 collectify-app.py
      </div>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The main screen is as shown in the following figure. The application's 
        structure is very simple: the main screen displays a list of saved 
        collections plus a button to add a new collection. Each collection 
        can be identified by a representative image as well as a title chosen 
        by the user.
      </p>

      <!--- FIGURA 1 - main window --->
      <div class="gallery-item">
          <img src="./assets/images/blog/collectify1.webp" class="box px-0 py-0 ml-auto mr-auto" width="70%" title="collectify1" alt="Main window of collectify">
      </div>
      
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Each list is clickable and leads to a second screen, which 
        we will examine in detail later. For now, let's simply click the "+" 
        button to open the tab that allows us to create a new list. 
        In the new window called "Create a new list", there are fields to 
        fill out. The first is the name you want to give to the collection. 
        It's recommended to use a short name that clearly identifies the 
        collection and, most importantly, one that is not already in use. 
        The second field specifies the number of items in the collection. 
        For example, the Rat-Man comics (original collection) consist of 
        122+1 (special issue) books, so one should enter 123. 
        You can also select a representative image for the collection. 
        It's recommended to use a rectangular image with good resolution. 
        If you don't have a representative image, no problem! The application 
        will assign a default image, identical to the one found in the test 
        list included when you download the repository. When an image is 
        chosen, it will appear in the collection creation screen. By pressing 
        the "Create list" button, the new collection will appear on the 
        main screen alongside the others already present.
      </p>

      <!--- FIGURA 2 - new collection --->

      <p class="noteBoxes type1"><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i><span>
        Note: Currently, there is no check for duplicate collection names, 
        so using an existing name might overwrite an existing collection! 
        This will be fixed soon.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        We've created a new collection. But what if we want to delete it, 
        reset it, rename it, or simply update what we own from that collection? 
        Nothing could be easier. Click on the specific collection in the main 
        screen, and a dedicated screen will open! The title of this screen 
        corresponds to the name of the collection. The screen prominently 
        displays the image chosen for the collection, and on the side, there 
        are several buttons to modify the collection's status.
        You can delete the collection, reset everything you own to zero, or 
        simply rename the collection. In the latter case, clicking the "Rename" 
        button will open a screen where you can enter the new name before 
        confirming the change.

        The other two buttons are used to update which items you own in the 
        collection; we'll explore their functionality in detail shortly. Just 
        below, there's a "completion bar". The goal of a true collector is to 
        reach 100%! In the meanwhile, having a bar to show how far you are 
        from that goal is certainly helpful. It's also useful to have a clear 
        view of the items you're missing in the collection. While it's true that 
        the numbers in the scrollable lower box turn green when you add an item 
        to the collection, the screen includes a handy drop-down menu that lets 
        you filter the items as owned or missing.
      </p>

      <!--- FIGURA 3 - drop down menu --->

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Let’s complete the explanation with how the buttons to add 
        items to ("Own +") or remove items from ("Own -") the 
        collection.
        <br><br> 
        Did you open a new pack of cards and find some missing ones? Add them! 
        <br>
        Did you trade or sell a comic, and it's no longer part of your collection? Remove it! 
        <br><br>
        To do so, use the "Own +" or "Own -" buttons. In both cases, a new screen will open.
        On this screen, you'll be prompted to enter a list of numbers (representing the 
        number of the card, comic, etc.). For both "Own +" and "Own -", you can add or 
        remove multiple items at once! Simply input multiple numbers separated by commas. 
        For the "Own +" button only, you can even quickly input a range of items: do you 
        own all the numbers from 33 to 46? Just use the two endpoints, separated by a dash.
        With a single click, the list is updated: the owned items turn green, while those 
        no longer in the collection revert to gray.
      <p>

      <!--- FIGURA 3 - own + --->

        <a href="#Improve" class="headerlink" title="Improve"></a>
        Things to improve
      </h2>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        There a couple of things that I'm aware should be improved. Precisely:
        <ul>
          <li>check a list already exists before creating a double (double-check collection names);</li>
          <li>request for confirmation when resetting / deleting a list;</li>
          <li>improve scroll with trackpad.</li>
        </ul>
        I'll fix them, as soon as I've time to do so! But for now, collectify 
        works just fine.
        <br><br>
        So, no more excuses! Gotta collect 'em all!
