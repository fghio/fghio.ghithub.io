        About me
      </h2>
      <p align="justify">
      My name is Federico Ghioldi, and I am a full-time researcher at 
      the 
      <a href="https://www.aero.polimi.it/en/" target="_blank">
        Department of Aerospace Science and Technologies</a>
      at 
      <a href="https://www.polimi.it/en/" target="_blank">
        Politecnico di Milano
      </a>.<br>
      Even though the "RTD-A" position remains an enigma 
      beyond our nation's borders, my dear colleagues say we're also 
      entitled to refer to ourselves as "Assistant Professors". 
      So, it seems I'm that too, among other things.<br> 
      Honestly, I see myself more as a Computational Fluid Dynamics 
      (CFD) developer and a problem-solving enthusiast. Indeed, I find 
      myself face to face with a multitude of challenges each day, and 
      much to my own surprise, I even manage to figure out a solution to 
      some of them (sometimes).

        Career
      </h2>
      <p align="justify">
      To make it simple: I took my BSc in Aerospace Engineering, my M.Sc. 
      in Aeronautical Engineering and my Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering 
      at Politecnico di Milano. Then, I applied for a RTD-A position at 
      the Department that raised me. So here I am.

        About this site
      </h2>
      <p align="justify">
      I began developing this website to address a minor issue: I just 
      wanted my business card to include a link to my CV, i.e. a PDF that I 
      could continually update. Things escalated quickly. 
      I experimented with several versions of the website before arriving 
      at its current state. This website's design is inspired by that of 
      <a href="https://leimao.github.io/" target="_blank">Lei Mao</a>, 
      with some modifications to both its features and appearance.<br>
      Anyway, here is what you're going to find in this website:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>My curriculum. [It would have been useless otherwise.]</li>
        <li>A blog to share my perspective on topics I find interesting
        (currently WiP).</li>
        <li>A list of the (side) projects I'm currently carrying out.</li>
        <li>A way to reach my office or contact me. [Use 
        that info only if absolutely necessary.]</li>
        <li>A list of frequently asked questions, especially 
        valuable for students in the courses for which I provide assistance.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      An important note: I can't stress enough that all opinions or views 
      contained in this website are my own. 
      </p>

        <a href="#Coming soon" class="headerlink" title="Sections"></a>
        Coming soon(er or later)
      </h2>
      <p>I plan to use the "blog" section as space to store my 
      observations or comments on several topics like CFD, physics, 
      breakthrough technologies, etc. On the other hand, I intend 
      the "project" space as a container that will include 
      step-by-step procedures I followed to overcome problems or 
      satisfy personal needs.      
      </p>
      
      <h2 id="Contact-Me">
        <a href="#Contact-Me" class="headerlink" title="Contact Me"></a>
        Are you sure you need to contact me?
      </h2>
      <p>I plan to upload my projects on 
        <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/fghio">my 
        personal GitHub</a> (provided they are intended to be open 
        source). In case of complaints, recommendations or bugs, 
        you can open an issue ticket in the corresponding repository. 
        Similarly, you find a space to reply below each post contained in 
        this website. Therefore, the personal information to 
        "Contact" me should only be used when strictly necessary.
